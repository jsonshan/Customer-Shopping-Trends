Data Analysis on Customer Shopping Trends

## Introductions
I haven't delved deep into this, but I plan to make 3 Excel files containing customer information/demographics(age, gender, subscription status, location, season, frequency of purchases), 
product details(category, size, color, rating), and purchase details(discounts, promo codes used, payment method, etc)

This will be interesting because I never split up Kaggle datasets before, but I did so to practice more on my joins, CTES, and Temp Tables ðŸ˜„
## Data Source
Dataset: This dataset was taken from the [Customer Shopping Trends Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset?select=shopping_trends_updated.csv) on Kaggle

The dataset uses three CSV files containing customer, product, and purchase information made from each sale all linked through Customer ID.

## Tools Used

Excel, SQL
